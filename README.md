# SCT_ML_01: House Price Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of a linear regression model to predict house prices based on their square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The model is trained using the Kaggle "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset.

## Key Objectives:
- Load and preprocess the data (handling missing values and feature scaling).
- Build and evaluate a linear regression model.
- Visualize key relationships between features and the target variable (price).
- Assess model performance using evaluation metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE.

## Dataset:
- The dataset used is from Kaggle and contains various features related to house prices.
